Neon writer
===========

Experiment using `canvas` to create an interactive flickering neon light drawing thingy. Experiment write up [here](http://neilcarpenter.com/labs/neon-writer/). Only really works reasonably in Chrome, needs some serious performance optimisation for other browsers before it will work acceptably.

**See live demo [here](http://neilcarpenter.com/demos/canvas/neon/)**

TO DO
- Add 'save as image feature' - *not as easy as it should be coz multiple canvases used and bg image/gradient is set in CSS*
